## Hello! 👋

- :man_technologist: I’m Rory, a passionate data enthusiast with a background in urban planning and real estate development.

- 👀 My interests lie at the intersection of using data and technology to improve how we build communities. I am a firm believer that many of the challenges faced by cities and real estate professionals can be resolved using a bit of code and an open mind.

- 🌱 I’m currently looking at development applications in the City of Toronto. I would like to work on a proof-of-concept application where the user specifies their development application parameters and then subsequently be provided with the likelihood that their application is approved or denied. Stay tuned!

- :rocket: Outside of my professional interests I am an avid cyclist, a foodie, a traveler, a guitar player, an ocassional woodworker, y hablo mucho español.
