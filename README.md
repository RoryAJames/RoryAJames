## Hello! 👋

- :man_technologist: I’m Rory, a passionate data enthusiast with a background in urban planning and real estate development.

- 👀 My interests lie at the intersection of using data and technology to improve how we build communities. I am a firm believer that many of the challenges faced by cities and real estate professionals can be resolved using a bit of code and an open mind.

- 🌱 I’m currently working on a proof-of-concept application that allows users to view development applications in the City of Toronto based on their interests. The app will also give users the option to predict the likelihood that a hypothetical application recieves approval. Stay tuned!

- :rocket: Outside of my professional interests I am an avid cyclist, a foodie, a traveler, a guitar player, an ocassional woodworker, y hablo mucho español.
