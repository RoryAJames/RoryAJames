## Hello! 👋

- :man_technologist: I’m Rory, a passionate data enthusiast that is inspired by innovation, growth, and change.

- 👀 My interests lie at the intersection of using data and technology to improve business operations and drive actionable insights. I am a firm believer that many of the analytical challenges faced by businesses can be resolved using a bit of code and an open mind.

- 🌱 I’m currently working on an ETL pipeline of the annual portfolio holdings of the Norwegian Oil Fund. The end result will be an application that allows a user to uncover insights into the funds holdings.

- :rocket: Outside of my professional interests I am an avid cyclist, a foodie, a traveler, a guitar player, an ocassional woodworker, y hablo mucho español.
