## Hello! 👋

- :man_technologist: I’m Rory, a passionate enthusiast transitioning from real estate development into all things data. 

- 👀 My interests lie at the intersection of using data and technology to improve operations and drive actionable insights. I am a firm believer that many of the analytical challenges faced by businesses can be resolved using a bit of code and an open mind.

- 🌱 I’m currently working on a web scraping project and touching up on my database skills.

- :rocket: Outside of my professional interests I am an avid cyclist, a foodie, a traveler, a guitar player, an ocassional woodworker, y hablo mucho español.
